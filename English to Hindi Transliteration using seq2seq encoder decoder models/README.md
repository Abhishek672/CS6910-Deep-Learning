0.Dataset Description : https://github.com/google-research-datasets/dakshina#:~:text=Dakshina%20Dataset,-The%20Dakshina%20dataset&text=South%20Asian%20languages.-,For%20each%20language%2C%20the%20dataset%20includes%20a%20large%20collection%20of,and%20the%20basic%20Latin%20alphabet.



1.This repo contains 2 Folders PartA and partB.PartA contains the answers for Q2,Q3 and Q4.

2.PartB contains the answers for the Q5 and Q6.

3.Each folder directory has further 2 ipython notebooks .One is with sweeps in wandb and other is using the best hyperparameters.

4.Additional Nirmala.ttf font and attention.py files provided which needed to be downloaded and uploaded to the colab session.

5.Prediction contains the predictions made by PartA model and PartB model as 2 .txt files.Each .txt file contains the predictions for the test data in order
and separated by new line character.

6.Due to time constraints the validation accuracy during each epoch is calculated via Teacher Forcing.
